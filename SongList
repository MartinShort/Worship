The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

For I know you satisfy

So I wait for you

Broken, I run to you
For your arms are open wide
I am weary, but I know
Your touch restores my life

So I wait for you
So I wait for you
I’m falling on my knees
Offering all of me

12. I cast my mind to Calvary
Where Jesus bled and died for me
I see his wounds, his hands, his feet
My Saviour on that cursed tree

His body bound and drenched in tears
They laid him down in Joseph's tomb
The entrance sealed by heavy stone
Messiah still and all alone

Chorus
O praise the name of the Lord our God
O praise His name forevermore
For endless days, we will sing your praise
Oh Lord, oh Lord our God

Then on the third, at break of dawn
The Son of Heaven rose again
O trampled death, where is your sting
The angels roar for Christ the King

He shall return in robes of white
The blazing sun shall pierce the night
And I will rise among the saints
My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face
 
13. For thou Oh Lord art high 
Above all the earth
Thou art exalted far above all gods.
For thou Oh Lord art high 
Above all the Earth
Thou art exalted far above all gods.

I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee,
I exalt Thee, Oh Lord.
I exalt Thee, I exalt Thee,
I exalt Thee, O Lord

 
14. I stand amazed in the presence 
Of Jesus the Nazarene 
And I wonder how He could love me, 
A sinner condemned, unclean. 

How marvellous, how wonderful 
And my song shall ever be. 
How marvellous, how wonderful 
Is my Saviour’s love for me. 

He took my sins and my sorrows, 
He made them His very own; 
He bore the burden to Calvary, 
And suffered and died alone. 

When with the ransomed in glory 
His face I at last shall see, 
It will be my joy thro' the ages, 
To sing of His love for me.

 
15. Jesus, Be The Centre,
Be my source, be my light, Jesus.

Jesus, be the centre,
Be my hope, be my song, Jesus.

Be the fire in my heart,
Be the wind in these sails,
Be the reason that I live,
Jesus, Jesus.

Jesus, be my vision,
Be my path, be my guide,
Jesus.

 
16. Let Everything That
Everything that
Everything that has breath
Praise the Lord.

Praise you in the morning
Praise you in the evening
Praise you when I’m young 
And when I’m old.
Praise you when I’m laughing
Praise you when I’m grieving
Praise you every season of the soul.

If we could see how much you’re worth
Your power, your might, your endless love
Then surely we would never cease to praise.

Joining with the angels
Praising you forever and a day
Praise you on the earth now

Lord we love to sing your praises
I'm so glad you're in my life

From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord we lift your name on high

 
19. Lord you have my heart 
And I will search for yours
Jesus take my life and lead me on

And as you show your face 
We'll see your glory here

With every beat of my heart 
With every breath 

In mansions of Glory
In endless delight

Then who could ever stop us.
And if our God is with us, 
Then what could stand against.
